USB-C powered Headphone Amplifier
Hello folks. This repository contains the gerber,BOM and schematic files of the USB-C PD headphone amp designed by me. The design is heavily inspired from the massively parellel NE5532 op-amp headphone amp designed by Phil's Lab. 
WARNING: I havent tested the board physically so I really have no idea how well it performs. If anyone of you manages to produce and test it out, please feel free to reach out to me at kaustubh.murudkar@gmail.com.
